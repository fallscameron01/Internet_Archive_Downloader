# Internet_Archive_Downloader

Python utility for downloading files from an archive on the Internet Archive. Uses the `internetarchive` package for downloading files. Utilizes multiprocessing to download multiple files simultaneously and speed up the download of archives with a large number of files.

## Usage ##

Can be used by either running `archive_downloader.py` with required arguments or
by importing the ArchiveDownloader function into your own program.

#### Details

An archive download requires specifying the identifier of the archive. The identifier tag can be found on the archive's details page. Additionally, a glob string may be specified to filter which items to download from an archive. The user must specify a location for the download to be output on disk.

The `ArchiveDownloader` class speeds up the downloading of an archive with a large number of files by splitting the files to download among simultaneous processes. This allows multiple files to be downloaded at the same time, increasing the total bandwidth available. By default, the `ArchiveDownloader` class will use 4 processes, but this number can be increased or decreased by specifying the `process_num` parameter.
